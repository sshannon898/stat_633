### Introduction 


* Small businesses serve as the backbone of the economy, fostering innovation, job creation, and local development. 

* However, access to financial resources remains a significant barrier to their growth, often influenced by the type of financial institutions and demographic factors.


* This study examines the lending patterns of different banks to understand their role in supporting small businesses. 

  * Specifically, it focuses on **Community Banks (CBOs), Large Banks (LBOs), and Regional Banks (RBOs)**.

  * The goal is to analyze how these institutions distribute small business loans and whether certain banks provide more access than others.


* Additionally, this study investigates the impact of **demographic factors** on loan distribution and approval rates, including:

  * **Income levels** – Do lower-income areas receive fewer loans?

  * **Race** – Are certain racial groups disproportionately affected in loan approvals?

  * **Geographic location** – How do urban and rural areas differ in accessing small business loans?

### Research Question


* This study examines:

  * **Which types of banks engage in small business lending** – Understanding the role of Community Banks (CBOs), Large Banks (LBOs), and Regional Banks (RBOs).

  * **How demographic factors influence loan distribution** – Analyzing the impact of income, race, and geographic location on loan approvals.

  * **How these relationships have evolved over time** – Examining trends in lending patterns and how they have changed due to economic and policy shifts.




### Key Findings


\newpage 


### Why is this important?


* Total Lending Trends:

  * Large Banks (LBOs) continue to dominate small business lending, issuing significantly higher loan amounts than Community Banks (CBOs) and Regional Banks (RBOs).

  * The total volume of small business loans has increased over time, but this growth is not evenly distributed across different bank types or geographic locations.


* Impact of Demographics on Loan Distribution:

  * Counties with higher median household income consistently receive higher loan amounts, reinforcing economic disparities.

  * Lower-income counties receive disproportionately fewer loans despite their business needs, suggesting a systemic bias in lending patterns.

  * The relationship between loan amount and income is stronger in wealthier regions, meaning banks are more willing to lend to higher-income areas while underserved regions struggle with access to credit.


* Evolution of Lending Behavior Over Time:

  * Loan approval patterns have shifted in response to economic and regulatory changes.

  * Certain years show dramatic changes in lending behavior, possibly due to policy adjustments, financial crises, or shifts in banking strategies.

  * The average loan amount per capita has increased for wealthier regions but remained stagnant for lower-income areas, widening the economic gap.


* Portfolio-Based Lending Differences:

  * LBOs lend in larger amounts but concentrate their lending in economically prosperous areas.

  * CBOs and RBOs provide more localized and smaller loans, which can be crucial for rural or lower-income regions.

  * Over time, the proportion of loans from CBOs and RBOs has declined, further reducing financing options for small businesses in disadvantaged areas.


* Loan Amounts vs. Number of Loans:

  * The data shows a growing gap between the total number of loans issued and the actual loan amounts given.

  * While large banks issue high-value loans, the number of small business loans issued has not increased at the same rate, meaning fewer small businesses receive funding despite rising total loan amounts.


* Geographic Inequality in Lending:

  * Lending is concentrated in metropolitan and high-income regions, leaving rural areas and lower-income communities with fewer resources.

  * The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) plays a role in shaping these trends, but it has not fully addressed the disparities in lending practices.


* These findings underscore the systemic biases in small business lending and highlight the critical role of financial institutions and policymakers in ensuring fair and equitable access to credit.

### The data


* CBO/LBO/RBO Definition:

  * **Community Banks (CBOs):** Smaller, locally focused banks that primarily serve small businesses and rural communities.

  * **Regional Banks (RBOs):** Mid-sized banks that operate across multiple states, providing a mix of local and corporate banking services.

  * **Large Banks (LBOs):** Major financial institutions with nationwide or global operations that provide high-volume lending but often favour large businesses over small enterprises.


* CRA (Community Reinvestment Act):

  * A federal law enacted in 1977 to prevent discriminatory lending practices (redlining).

  * Requires banks to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities.

  * Encourages transparency in lending and promotes equal access to credit.


* ACS (American Community Survey):

  * A nationwide survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau to collect detailed demographic, economic, and housing data.

  * Provides critical information on population characteristics, income levels, and housing patterns, which are used to analyze lending disparities.

  * Helps in identifying which communities face challenges in accessing credit and financial services.
