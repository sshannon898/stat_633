## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, warn.conflicts =FALSE, results = 'hide'}

library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warn.conflicts = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

## WITHOUT grouping by portfolio
## Also takes forever to compile, so perhaps filter out some years?
## Also I made two plots: one with a log transform and one without.

# plot2_log <- county_acs_data |>
#   filter(!is.na(sum_loan_amt), !is.na(Median_HH_Income)) |>
#   ggplot() +
#   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log(sum_loan_amt),
#                            y = log(Median_HH_Income),
#                            color = year,
#                            text = paste0("County: ", County, "<br>Total Loan Amount: ", sum_loan_amt, "<br>Median Household Income: ", Median_HH_Income, "<br>Year:", year))) +
#   labs(x = "Log of Loan Amount Sum",
#        y = "Log of Median Household Income",
#        title = "Loan Amounts vs. Median Household Income")

plot2 <- county_acs_data |>
  filter(!is.na(sum_loan_amt), !is.na(Median_HH_Income)) |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = sum_loan_amt,
                           y = Median_HH_Income,
                           frame = year,
                           # color = year,
                           text = paste0("County: ", County, "<br>Total Loan Amount: ", sum_loan_amt, "<br>Median Household Income: ", Median_HH_Income, "<br>Year:", year))) +
  labs(x = "Loan Amount Sum",
       y = "Median Household Income",
       title = "Loan Amounts vs. Median Household Income")
 

ggplotly(plot2,
         tooltip = "text")
```

## Plot 3

```{r}

## WITH portfolio grouping

(plot3 <- county_acs_data |>
  filter(!is.na(year), !is.na(sum_n_loans), !is.na(sum_loan_amt)) |>
  group_by(portfolio, year) |>
  summarize(total_sum_n_loans = sum(sum_n_loans),

  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_sum_loan_amounts, color = portfolio)) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Average Loan Amount",
       title = "Total Loans Given Out Each Year by Bank Type"))
